  // We accept any term, although only three cases are possible:
  // Sortclass, the class of sorts; its objects are the terms whose type is a sort.
  // Funclass, the class of functions; its objects are all the terms with a functional type,
  //            i.e. of form forall  x:A, B.
  // Any QualId that refer to terms of the types above are also acceptable.
